# Anomaly-Detection-System-Using-Machine-Learning
Final Year Project as A Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (Data Science)
### Objectives:
1. To compare Supervised Machine Learning algorithms, including Decision Trees, 
Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Logistic Regression, K
Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Regression for anomaly 
classification in IoT environments. 
2. To evaluate the model's performance on simulated IoT datasets using evaluation 
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. 
3. To integrate confidence scoring on the best machine learning model. 
4. To provide a visualization dashboard to showcase the model's result comparison, 
anomaly detection overview and the chosen model's confidence scoring.
